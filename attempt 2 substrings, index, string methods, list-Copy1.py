# # Objectives Week 4
# 
# 1. Understand lists in python programming, 
# 2. list functions, 
# 3. tuples, 
# 4. methods and functions,
# 5. if statements and comparisons in **python** **bold text**
# 6. by the end of the week, you will learn to develop a text parser, a program that the user will enter any kind of text and the code will give them any information about that text: you will have to learn the index method, extracting sub-strings, methods and properties of string.
# ## copy this to your own drive

# # First lets go over simpler index methods
# 

# In[ ]:


#we know the traditional way. You might find this way annoying. 
#There are several other ways you can format or insert variables into string texts
#lets take a look at indexing in python again

#lets take a look at substrings

# # Lists

# In[ ]:


#Lists allow you to store multiple items in one variable instead of separate items
#now you are entering the world of data structures
#lists are known as arrays in other programs
#python calls arrays lists --> they are like a book shelf of items
#List are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of object types
#They use [] brackets and commas to separate objects in a the list
#[1,2,3,4,5]
#List support indexing and slicing. Lists can be nested and also have a variety of useful methods that can be called off of them.#

apples = 3
oranges = 4
grapes = 50
mangos = 5
#list
groceries = [apples, oranges, grapes, mangos]
print(groceries)
print(groceries[-1])

#CREATE  A LIST OF FRIENDS AND print out the 1st and last friend
friends = []

#lists are mutable -- means I can change it


# In[2]:


birthday_guests = ["femi", "will", "luis"]
Christmas_guests =["hou", "jessie","Tom"]

#joins my list 
#concatenation
#remove
# birthday_guests[0] ="charlie"


# add

#sort


#.remove(), .append(), sort(), .len() are list functions


# In[3]:


#also we can define N dimensional list not just 1 dimensional
#1 dimensional means only one item per comma


# In[ ]:





# In[ ]:


#create a list that contains at least one string, one integer and one float
#for example: [1, "two", 3.14566]
#Note that the order and number of items doesnt matter


# # List functions

# In[ ]:


#how do we recognize a function????

#.remove()


# In[ ]:


#.append()


# In[ ]:


#.pop()


# In[ ]:


#.sort()
#.reverse()


# In[2]:


#.insert(index, value)


# In[ ]:


#.index(value)


# In[ ]:


#.extend()


# In[ ]:


#.copy()


# #Tuples

# In[ ]:


# exactly the same thing as an array only it is immutable, once you define the tuple, you cannot change it


# In[1]:


#you define a tuple with () instead of [] like you would in lists
#once you define it, you cannot change it
#example
coordinates = (4,5)


# #Functions and methods

# In[ ]:





# #return statement
